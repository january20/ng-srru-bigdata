Information-Centric Networking (ICN) is an approach to evolve
the Internet infrastructure to directly support accessing Named Data
Objects (NDOs) as a first-order network service.

Information Centric Networking (ICN) is a new paradigm where
the network provides users with named content, instead of
communication channels between hosts.

Content-Centric Networking (CCNx) is a network protocol
that uses a hierarchical name to forward requests and to
match responses to requests.

This document describes the core concepts of the Content-Centric
Networking (CCNx) architecture and presents a network protocol based
on two messages: Interests and Content Objects.

Information-centric networking (ICN) marks a fundamental shift in
communications and networking.

In networking scenarios with an increasing number of wireless
systems, there are two networking paradigms highly correlated
to the efficiency of pervasive data sharing: Information-Centric
Networking (ICN), and opportunistic wireless networking.

Information-Centric Networking (ICN) is now reaching technological
maturity after many years of fundamental research and
experimentation.

Information-Centric Networks in general, and Content-Centric
Networking (CCN) [3] or Named Data Networking (NDN) [4] in
particular, are the emerging network architectures enabling in-
network caching and data retrievals through their names.
